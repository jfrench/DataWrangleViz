        "More helpfully, Quarto is the spiritual successor to R Markdown that was built from the ground up to be compatible with:\n",

        "-   Python\n",
        "-   Julia\n",

        "\n",
        "The R Markdown ecosystem was very mature when the decision to develop Quarto was made, so Quarto is designed to better integrate the various document types, options, and customizations available in R Markdown. Essentially, Quarto attempts to take the strengths of R Markdown while correcting some of its weaknesses.\n",
