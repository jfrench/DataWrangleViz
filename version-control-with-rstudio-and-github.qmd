Data scientists should have an intentional process for tracking changes in their code over time. 

- This process is known **version control**.

In ancient times, like the early 2000s, we simply renamed our files manually:

- `mycode.R`
- `mycode_v2.R`
- `mycode_final.R`
- `mycode_reallyfinalv2.R`

In modern times, version control is automatic in my contexts.

- Microsoft Word stores versions of a file each time it is saved. We can restore old version if we make a mistake.
- Dropbox automatically saves versions of files each time they are changed. Users can restore old versions of files within a certain time period (30 days to 1 year depending on a user's subscription level).

The industry standard for version control of computer code and software is git. 
We will learn how to use git from within R Studio while using GitHub to host our code and version control data.

## What is git?

<img src="./figures/git_logo.png" width="25%" />

Software developers need a fast, reliable way of tracking changes to their source code when working as individuals or as part of a team. 

The best-in-class approach to software version control is git, which was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to improve on the version control applications available at the time.

From [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/):

> Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. 

By default, git tracks files changed in a directory or repository locally, i.e., on our actual computer, which can create some potential challenges:

- git does not backup our code or changes, which would be problematic if our computer becomes compromised..
- A centralized repository must be available when multiple contributors are working on the same project. There needs to be a way of easily managing each person's contributions and keeping track of the development and stable branches of the code.

GitHub is the most popular solution for these two issues.

## What is GitHub?

<img src="./figures/github_cat.png" height="200" /><img src="./figures/github_logo.png" height="200" />

GitHub ([https://www.github.com](https://www.github.com)) is an online platform for hosting git repositories.

GitHub makes it easy to:

- Control who is able to access and change a repository.
- Track bugs in our code.
- Keep record of feature requests.
- Delegate responsibilities.
- Maintain a wiki.
- etc.

GitHub is a great place to:

- Backup and maintain version control of our software.
- Make our software public and allow others to contribute and interact with our work. 
- Demonstrate our coding skills and abilities by creating publicly available project repositories.
- Host a professional website for potential employers or clients.

## Linking RStudio and GitHub

We can use RStudio to manage a local git repository and push the changes to GitHub.com.

We outline the setup process below.

We assume that both R ([https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)) and RStudio ([https://posit.co/downloads](https://posit.co/downloads)) are installed.

### Create a GitHub account

First, we create a GitHub account.

- Navigate to [https://github.com](https://github.com)
- Click Sign Up.

<img src="./figures/github_home_signup.png" width="100%" />

- Choose an email address to associate with your GitHub account.
    - Educational users with a `.edu` email addresses can upgrade for free to a GitHub Pro account.
- Choose a strong password.
- Select a username.
    - Think long term about this username. It may be an account that follows you for much of your professional life!
    - Good choices are related to your name.
        - E.g., if my name is John Q Smith, some good options might be `jsmith`, `jqsmith`, `john-smith`, `john-q-smith`, etc.
    - Bad choices are not professional or unique.
        - E.g., `jsmith198451`, `i-love-cereal`, `PartyKing`.
- Continue the registration process.

<img src="./figures/github_signup_screen.png" width="100%" />

### Install git

Next, we install a version of git to our computer.

Download and install the appropriate version of git from  [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

<img src="./figures/git_download.png" width="100%" />

In general, it is best to install git using all the default settings.

### Verifying communication between git and RStudio

We need to make sure that RStudio is aware of the location of the git program on our computer.

- Navigate to Global Options (under Tools for Windows machines and currently under Edit &rarr; Preferences for a Mac).
- Click Git/SVN.

<img src="./figures/git_svn.png" width="100%" />

Ensure that RStudio has automatically discovered the file path of the git executable.

- If this is not the case, then you will manually have to figure this out.
- You may need to do some web sleuthing to figure out how to do this.

<img src="./figures/git_location.png" width="100%" />

To verify that RStudio has the correct path to git:

- Click `Alt + Shift + R` on a Windows computer or `Option + Shift + R` on a Mac to open a new terminal window.
- Type `git --version` in the Terminal window and press enter.
- If RStudio is looking in the correct location for git, then the current install version of git will be printed in the Terminal window.

<img src="./figures/git_version_output.png" width="100%" />

### Authorizing RStudio to access GitHub

Next, we make sure that RStudio can talk with GitHub. 

We must specify our username and email address using `git config` via the terminal.

```
git config --global user.name 'myusername'
git config --global user.email 'myemail@email.edu'
```

<img src="./figures/git_config.png" width="100%" />

To link RStudio with GitHub, we need to set our GitHub credentials in RStudio.

Install the **gitcreds** package.

- Run `install.packages("gitcreds")` in the R Console.
- Run `library(gitcreds)` in the R Console to attach the **gitcreds** package.

We need to create a Personal Access Token to link RStudio with GitHub.

- Click on your Profile photo.
- Click Settings.

<img src="./figures/github_settings.png" width="100%" />

- Click Developer settings. 

<img src="./figures/developer_settings.png" width="100%" />

- Under Personal Access Tokens, click Tokens (classic).

<img src="./figures/personal_access_tokens.png" width="100%" />

- Write a Note (perhaps which computer the access is being granted to).
- Select when the token will expire (shorter is more secure).
- Select the access we want to grant, if being cautious. **Make sure to select repo access!**
- Click Generate token at the bottom of the page.

<img src="./figures/personal_access_tokens_2.png" width="100%" />

- Copy the token.

<img src="./figures/personal_access_tokens_3.png" width="100%" />

- Run `gitcreds_set()` in the R Console.
- Paste the token you copied into the Console and hit Enter.

RStudio/git should be linked with GitHub!

## RStudio version control when cloning an existing GitHub repository

There are different ways to manage the version control workflow from within R.

We present the most basic workflow, which is to enable version control for a new project cloned from an existing GitHub repository.

### Starting from a "blank" GitHub repository

Create a new repository on GitHub by clicking New on on your GitHub homepage.

- We will create a new repository named "mytest". 

<img src="./figures/new_repository.png" width="100%" />

- Name your new repository, make it public, click Create Repository.

<img src="./figures/new_repository_2.png" width="100%" />

- Copy the url at the top of the repository.

<img src="./figures/new_repository_https.png" width="100%" />

### Starting from an established GitHub repository

Navigate to an existing GitHub repository and copy the url at the top of the repository, just like the last step of the previous section.

### Start a version controlled New Project

Next, create a New Project using version control.

- Click File &rarr; New Project.
- Click Version Control.

<img src="./figures/version_control.png" width="100%" />

- Click Git.

<img src="./figures/version_control_git.png" width="100%" />

- Paste the url, click Create Project.

<img src="./figures/clone_git_repository.png" width="100%" />

If everything is connected correctly, the newly cloned project should include a Git tab in the Environment pane.

<img src="./figures/git_tab_pane.png" width="100%" />

### Basic workflow

The basic workflow when using RStudio to do version control is:

- Add/edit files in the current project.
- Add the appropriate files to the staging area.
- Commit the changes to the local git repository and provide a short description of the changes made.
- Push the changes from the local repository to a remote repository (GitHub).

We provide a simple example.

### Change some code

- Open a new R Script (`Ctrl + Shift + N` on a Windows computer or `Cmd + Shift + N` on a Mac).
- Add a single command to the first line of the file: `print("Hello, world!")`.
- Save the file as `test.R`.

<img src="./figures/test_r_file.png" width="100%" />

### Stage the changes

In the Git tab of the Environment pane: 

- Check the box next to "test.R". 
- Click the Commit button.

<img src="./figures/stage.png" width="100%" />

### Commit the changes to the local repository

- Review changes.
- Add a Commit message.
    - This is a brief description of the changes made in the commit.
- Click Commit.

<img src="./figures/commit.png" width="100%" />

### Push the changes to the remote repository

After you close the Commit window, click Push in the Git tab of the Environment pane to push the changes from the local repository to GitHub.

<img src="./figures/push.png" width="100%" />

The changes should be pushed to your GitHub repository, which you can see if you go to that repository on your GitHub page.

- We can see that `test.R` has been added to our "mytest" repository on GitHub.

<img src="./figures/github_pushed_changes.png" width="100%" />

## Adding RStudio version control to a local RStudio project

Suppose we want to use version control for a local RStudio project that isn't already linked to a git repository.

A local RStudio project can be created in two ways.

### Creating a New Project with a New Directory

We first discuss creating a new RStudio project with a new directory.

- Create a New Project by first clicking File &rarr; New Project.

<img src="./figures/new_project_wizard.png" width="100%" />

- Select New Directory.

<img src="./figures/new_project_dialog.png" width="100%" />

- Name the new directory ("test2" in our case),  uncheck the "Create a git repository" box (we will do this manually), and click Create Project.
 
<img src="./figures/new_project_wizard_test2.png" width="100%" />

### Creating a New Project from an existing directory

We now discuss creating a new RStudio project from an existing directory.

- Create a New Project by first clicking File &rarr; New Project.

<img src="./figures/new_project_wizard.png" width="100%" />

- Select Existing Directory.

<img src="./figures/new_project_dialog.png" width="100%" />

- Browse to the existing folder we want to turn into a project and click Create Project.

<img src="./figures/new_project_wizard_existing.png" width="100%" />

### Adding version control 

To add GitHub version control to an existing RStudio project, we need a place to store the remote repository.

First, create a new repository on GitHub.com to store the project.

- Usually, the repository name is the same as your project name, but it doesn't have to be.
- In our example, the project name and GitHub repository name are both "test2".

Next, open a terminal window in RStudio and run the following commands:

- Run `git init` to initialize git for this project.
    - You only need to do this if no git repository is already initialized.
    - If you check "Create a git repository" when creating a New Project then you can skip this step.
- Run `git add --all` to stage all project files.
- Run `git commit -m "initial commit" to make our first commit.
- Run `git branch -M main` to declare the branch ("main" is the default).
- Run `git remote add origin https://github.com/username/reponame.git` to link the remote repository to the local repository.
    - Replace `username` and `reponame` with the correct text.
- Run `git push -u origin main` to push the commit from the local repository to GitHub.

In order the commands are:

```
git init
git add --all
git commit -m "initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/reponame.git
git push -u origin main
```

<img src="./figures/git_init_manual.png" width="100%" />

If you close and reopen the project in RStudio, then we should see the Git tab in the Environment pane.
